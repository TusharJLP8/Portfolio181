        <h2>My Journey into Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>Posted on October 24, 2024</p>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my very first blog post! I am excited to share my journey into cloud computing and what drives my passion for this incredible technology.</p>
        <p>My interest in cloud computing started when I began exploring how cloud platforms like AWS are transforming the way businesses operate. Initially, I worked in roles where I was heavily involved with Excel, SQL, and process automation. However, I realized that the future lies in scalable, reliable cloud infrastructure, and I was eager to be part of this change.</p>
        <p>In September 2023, I officially joined Amazon, where I further expanded my knowledge of cloud technologies and DevOps principles. As a cloud enthusiast, I have enjoyed learning about AWS services, working on real-world projects, and earning certifications like the AWS Solutions Architect Associate.</p>
        <p>This blog will be my space to document new learnings, share interesting insights, and track my progress in the world of cloud computing. Stay tuned for more posts, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading, and I’m excited to continue this journey together!</p>
